### Major projects

> #### ***1. Synaptic basis of visual computations***
>
> Single neurons are driven by huge populations of synapses. In the visual system, single neurons are highly selective for features in the world (often in an invariant manner). In carnivores and primates, a tremendous amount of visual selectivity emerges in the primary visual cortex. This project aims to understand how selectivity emerges in single neurons; how synaptic *inputs* are transformed into somatic *outputs* (i.e. spikes). This project uses in vivo multiphoton calcium imaging of synaptic networks on single pyramidal cortical neurons, taking advantage of dendritic spines which are major site of excitatory input innervation. Understanding input/output transformations in single neurons in the visual system will provide much needed insight into the nature of neural computation.

#### ***2. Probing the behavior of visual circuits in action***

> Each neuronâ€™s population of presynaptic partners determines how incoming information is processed. A majority of synaptic inputs originate from local networks through horizontal (recurrent) connections. Theoretical models of the visual system suggest these inputs perform a fundamental function in cortical circuits: selective modulation. Specifically, selective amplification or attenuation in a manner dependent on the strength and statistics of incoming sensory information. But this process has not been elucidated at the synaptic level, and the mechanisms proposed by stem from studies of rodents and have not been tested in different mammalian systems. This project aims to map presynaptic excitatory and inhibitory cells of single layer 2/3 neurons and dissect how they act to selectively modulate the behavior of neural circuits in a carnivore. This project utilizes a combination of in vivo multiphoton optogenetic neural control, multiphoton calcium imaging, and intracellular electrophysiology.

#### ***3. Effects of genes associated with Austism Spectrum Disorder on cortical synaptic networks***

> Synaptic pathology is a prominent feature of autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and synaptic dysfunction is presumed to be an underlying cause of ASD, as genomic studies have identified risk genes encoding proteins which regulate synaptic structure and physiology. One candidate gene strongly associated with ASD and other CNS disorders is Phosphatase and tensin homolog located on chromosome 10 (*Pten*). While global mouse models with dysfunctional Pten exhibit synaptic pathology and mimic ASD symptoms, it isunclear how synaptic integration, organization, and function are impacted within individual neurons. This project aims to understand how Pten signaling shapes synaptic integration and functional architecture in single neurons. This collaborative project uses CRISPR/Cas9 in single neurons in combination with *in vivo* synaptic calcium imaging. This unique approach will precisely assess single neurons from a postsynaptic perspective, without potential confounds of mouse models with broad, distributed pathology.
