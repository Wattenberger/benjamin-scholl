I am interested in mechanisms of cortical sensory processing: how neurons recieve information from the world and transform it into electrical activity used to mediate behaviors. Previously I worked in the auditory system, but I currently focus on primary visual cortex and study it in a number of mammalian species. I use a variety of techniques including in vivo two-photon microscopy to measure activity from neural populations and in vivo whole cell recordings to reveal underyling synaptic mechanisms.

### Research Interests

* Organization of neuron sensory selectivitie]s
* Membrane potential dynamics in awake beahvi]ng animals
* Investigating properties of subcortical and] cortical circuitry
* Testing computational network models with p]hysiological measurements
* Excitatory and inhibitory inputs underlying] neuron response properties
* Developmental plasticity]
* Evolution of the mammalian cerebral cortex]
* Audiovisual behavior and circuit plasticity]

### Current Projects

* Membrane potential dynamics in awake-behaving primates
* Emergence of direction selectivity in the cerebral cortex
* The evolution of orientation selectivity and a cortical map
* Binocular plasticity and development in circuits
* Response dynamics and varability of simple and complex cells
* Computing stereoscopic depth
* Roles of synaptic inhbition in shaping tuning for sensory inputs
