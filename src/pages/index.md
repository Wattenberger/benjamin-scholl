I am interested in mechanisms of cortical sensory processing: how neurons recieve information from the world and transform it into electrical activity used to mediate behaviors. Previously I worked in the auditory system, but I currently focus on primary visual cortex and study it in a number of mammalian species. I use a variety of techniques including in vivo two-photon microscopy to measure activity from neural populations and in vivo whole cell recordings to reveal underyling synaptic mechanisms..
